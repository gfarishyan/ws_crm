# ws_crm
This is a just sample crm build for Drupal 7, which does not include any permissions and security into account.


The module(s) consist of ws_crm which doijng nothing in this case and used just for grouping purposes.

Ws_crm_customer and ws_crm_request depends on modules
Entity
views
views_bulk_operations


I would recommend first install ws_crm_customer
and after it ws_crm_request.


As this is a just a test shou;dn't be used on production enmvironments and not fully functional.
